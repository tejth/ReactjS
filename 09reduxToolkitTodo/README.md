# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<p>The above project is created to understand the concept of redux tooolkit </p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure Store: Redux Toolkit includes a configureStore function which simplifies the setup of a Redux store    </li>
  <li>            Reducers: Redux Toolkit introduces a createSlice function that allows you to write Redux reducers in a simpler way. It combines reducer logic and action creators into a single function, reducing the need for writing separate action types and action creators.            </li>
</ul>
